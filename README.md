# nostr-profile

This repository is a workbench for testing several implementation possibilities of the nostr protocol.
Feel free to fork and do your own things with it.

## Proof-of-Work (Mining)

My adblocker had an issue with the name `miner.js`, so I called it `PoWer.js` (Proof-of-Work (min)er). You're welcome strangers in exploring [NIP-13](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/13.md).

## Tests

The tests work if you run them one at a time.
